# Avalon  | Bugtracker

This platform is a dedicated place for Avalon Bugtracking. Allow the developers to easily manage our issues within the game and notify you the users about how and when we resolved it and or otherwise.

# Best way to post

The best way to post is to simply click on the "Issues" tab -> "New Issue" -> and follow the pre-written format to the best of your capability.

# When will bugs be resolved?

This variates a lot from bug to bug. Some may take no more than a couple of hours to fix, where others will take an amount we are unable to even estimate. The most important part is not to have it resolved as quickly as possible (alltho that is always preferred), but to have it logged and documented. We will be able to resolve it at *some point*. But we need to be aware of it in order to resolve it 

You have our gratitude and many thanks for helping us in documenting our problems and issues within Avalon Classless!
